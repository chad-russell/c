  #   services: []
# Service Naming Convention:
# - Each service corresponds to a directory under services/
# - Service files should follow the pattern:
#   - servicename.container (main container)
#   - servicename-*.container (additional containers)
#   - servicename.network
#   - servicename-*.volume
#   - servicename.pod
#
# Example: The 'pinepods' service includes all files in services/pinepods/
